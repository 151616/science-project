    Fragile X syndrome is a rare genetic disorder which is caused by a change to a gene on the X chromosome, which is called FMR1 gene. This FMR1 gene is being abnormally duplicated. An healthy human has about 5-40 CGG strands in their FMR1 gene, while a person with FXS has more than 200. We need the FMR1 gene to make a protein called FMRP, which is used for regulating productions of other protiens, and helps in the development of synapses. People who have FXS or have other FX-related disorders do not or barely make this protein. People with FXS are more sensitive to light, sound, smell, taste, and textures.

 There are many ways this disorder affects the body and mind. Some examples are large ears, long face, prominant jaw and forehead, flat feets, and unusually flexible fingers. Other are delays in talking, anxiety, being hyperactive, aggression,and repetitive actions. People with FXS have problems with momory, abstract thinking, problem solving and planning. This genetic disorder can be passed down to the offspring, because it's X linked, which means it's inside the X chromosomes, which is being passed down from generation to generation. FXS is sex-linked, because it affects one of the X chromosomes.

    About one in every 4,000 males have FXS, and one in every 8,000 females have FXS. This disorder does not have a cure, but it can be treated using therapy to help to learn to walk, talk, and interact with others better. This disorder is usually recognized at infants or toddlers.Medicine can be used to help with behavior problems. To find out if someone has FXS or not, they use a blood sample to detect any problems in the FMR1 gene. The life expectancy of people with this disorder is normally average. Fragile X syndrome is the leading cause of intellectual disablities.
